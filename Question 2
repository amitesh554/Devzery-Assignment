1) Click the "Buy Now" button. Does it take you to a page with all your items, prices, and quantities? (Check if x, y, z, a, and b are there!)

2) Is your shipping address correct? If not, can you easily fix it?

3) Choose how you want your stuff delivered (fast or slow?). Does the price change depending on your choice?

4) Double-check your billing address (where the bill goes). Is it right?

5) Pick how you want to pay (credit card, gift card, etc.). Is it a method you can use?

6) Do you have a discount code? Try it! Does it work and lower the price?

7) Look at the final order summary. Are all the items, prices, and shipping costs correct?

8) Click "Place Your Order"! Do you see a confirmation page with an order number?

9)Check your email! Did you get an order confirmation with details and a tracking link?
